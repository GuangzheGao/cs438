A basic implementation of client-server connection in python. 


For the server side, ./server is used to set up server.(python instead of ./ in windows) Client queue is defined by parameter MAX_CLIENTS.(default to be 100)  It will use HOST = 'localhost', 
PORT = 4000(should not be priviledged). 

The server side will respond according to the request, if request is valid, then 200 OK, content length,
 
and file will be tansmitted to the client. Only GET request will be acknowledged by the server as valid http-method in this MP.(other requests are acknowledged as 400 bad request response) 

Test filenames are are mp1_test1 to mp1_test6, which are of size 1,100,1000,10000,100000,1000000 bytes respectively.(bad path name requests will result 404 not found response)





For the client side, ./client <servername> <port> <filename> will be used to request(python instead of ./ in windows). Definitions are following MP documentation

Client side will time the time from request until receive files fully. 



Time analysis, python timing for test files , 10 loops average:
